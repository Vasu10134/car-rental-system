# 🚗 Car Rental System 🏎️

This project is a simple Java-based **Car Rental System**, designed to simulate the basic operations of a car rental service. It uses a **MySQL** database to store car, user, and rental data. The system allows users to register, view available cars, and rent cars.

## 🌟 Features:
- **User registration and login** 🔑
- **View available cars** 🚘
- **Rent a car** 🏁
- **View rented cars** 📋

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Java** for backend logic ☕
- **MySQL** for database management 🗄️

## 📋 Setup Instructions:
1. Create a MySQL database and tables by running `create_database.sql` 🗃️.
2. Configure your MySQL connection details in the `DatabaseHelper.java` file 🔧.
3. Compile all Java files and run the `CarRentalSystem.java` class to interact with the system 🖥️.

## ▶️ How to Run:
1. Compile all Java files 💻.
2. Run `CarRentalSystem.java` to simulate the car rental system 🚗.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to register, view available cars, and rent cars 🛣️.

## 🚨 Additional Notes:
- Make sure MySQL is running on your machine and the database connection is properly configured before running the system ⚙️.
- Ensure the `create_database.sql` file has been executed successfully to set up the necessary tables and data 🗂️.
